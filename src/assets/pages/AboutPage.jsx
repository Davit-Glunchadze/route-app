      <h1>About Michael Jackson</h1>
      <p>
        Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American
        singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of
        Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant figures of the 20th
        century. Over a four-decade career, his music achievements broke racial
        barriers in America and made him a dominant figure across the world.
        Through songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance
        for artists in popular music; popularizing street dance moves including
        the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is often
        deemed the greatest entertainer of all time based on his acclaim and
        records.
